# interop-privacy
Privacy is an essential feature of the Web platform, but often lacks testing.

As part of [Interop 2025](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/blob/main/2025/README.md), this new investigation area aims to: 
* determine what privacy-related standardized features need tests,
* develop automated tests or document manual tests,
* and improve interoperability of existing privacy protections.

## Rationale
Privacy is an actively developed area on the Web platform, but doesn't have very comprehensive testing in Web Platform Tests. Developers struggle with interoperability concerns when different browsers implement different privacy protections, and users struggle with a lack of privacy protections on the Web and often just give up trying to understand how their data is collected and used.
